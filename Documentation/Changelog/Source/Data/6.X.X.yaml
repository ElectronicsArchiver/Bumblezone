                Set the base of lit Super Candles/Incense Candles to return fire damage type for pathfinding.
                Should help stop other mod's mobs from pathfinding through the lit candles and burning.


            -   Fixed weird lighting on Porous Honeycomb Block when it is in item form.

        Items:

                Added three tags to make it easier to define what items will  
                lure Beehemoth and what item can lure / breed Honey Slime.
                
                Honey Slime will now follow players holding VanillaTweaks or  
                Supplementaries's Sugar Block and can be bred with that along  
                with vanilla's Sugar item.
                
                Candylands's Sugar brick, Crystalized Sugar, and  
                Glazed Sugar can be used with Honey Slime too now.

                Hanging Garden structure will now be able to randomly spawn flowering leaves or logs from other mods!
                This includes some leaves/logs from Oh The Biomes You'll Go, Biomes O Plenty, Quark, Ecologics, Terrestria, 
                Fruit Trees, Cherry Blossom Grotto, Colorful Azaleas, Blossom, and Aurora's Decorations!
                The new block tags that control this are:

        Items:
            
            -   Pollen Puff pollination json files will now safely skip invalid entries and parse the rest of the json file if a typo is done on a mob name.

        Mod Compatibility:
            
            -   Pollen Puff hitting Ars Elemental's Flashing Weald Walker will spawn Flashing Archwood Sapling nearby

            -   Fixed broken Pollen Puff entry for Ars Nouveau's Flourishing Weald Walker causing all walkers to not spawn their saplings when hit with the puff.

            -   Natural Decoration's snail and butterflies will spawn in Hanging Gardens now.

            -   |
                Changed my mind and now Biome Makeover's Black Thistle and Blue Skies's Lucentroot flowers no longer spawn in Hanging Garden structure now.
                Also blacklisted several flowers from Natural Decor Mod and Natural Expansion mod due to not looking good in structure. 

            -   |
                Broglis Plants's Nightshade, Oaks Nature's flowers, Biomes O Plenty's cherry/flowering oak sapling,
                Cherry Blossom Grotto's cherry sapling, Fruit Trees's cherry and redlove sapling will spawn in Hanging Garden.

            -   |
                Pokecube's Purple Wisteria Vines or Polluting Blossom and Extended Mushroom's Infected Flower will no longer spawn in Hanging Gardens 
                (Infected Flower will not be able to be reproduced with Pollen Puff either anymore)

            -   |
                Pokecube's bear themed Pokemon will now get Wrath of the Hive when in Bumblezone and attacked by bees!
                Careful on what Pokemon you choose in that dimension!

            -   Alchemist's Garden's Shroom mobs will spawn their respective mushrooms when hit with Pollen Puff.

            -   |
                Fixed incompatibility with Forgery mod's Weaponized Enderpearl settings. You can now still teleport into Bumblezone with Enderpearl.
                Had to switch from an Enderpearl specific event to a general projectile impact event as Forgery will skip firing the Forge Enderpearl teleport event entirely.

                Significantly fixed rendering issues with Honey Fluid and Royal Jelly Fluid.
                Also fixed particles from fluid spawning way out of the fluid at times.

            -   Fixed issue where Sugar Water fluid cannot damage blazes nor allow fish to swim and other behaviors that Forge's Fluid API is currently having issues with.

        Miscellaneous:
            
            -   |
                Fixed bug with vanilla Bees that make them not threadsafe when created as part of worldgen threaded chunk creation.
                Very niche rare crash to even get to happen but good for me to still patch just in case it does cause issues for people rarely.

            -   Cleaned up some more mixins to make them more stackable with other people's mixins

        Items:
            
            -   Fixed Pollen Puff sometimes placing blocks at invalid locations like Biome Makeover's Moth Blossom flower in midair.

        Mod Compatibility:

                Reduce chance of maps in Hive Temple loot a little bit.
                Increased number of threads spawned by Bumblezone so multiple Hive Temple maps and Honey Compasses can search at once from 1 to 3.

        Fluids:
            
            -   Fixed being able to "jump" while on ground inside Royal Jelly Fluid.

        Miscellaneous:
            
            -   Fixed LGBT+ and Ukraine Bee Skin configs fighting each other on applying. And changed the default config values for them.

            -   Went through and cleaned up and modified several mixins to make some of them less hacky. Converted some to Forge events.

        Teleportation:

                Finally found a solution to make sure player teleports straight to destination spot in Bumblezone instead of briefly in 
                the ground while the game catches up to the teleport code. Needed to call serverPlayer.moveTo before serverPlayer.teleportTo
                since serverPlayer.teleportTo changes dimension and then has a lag for updating the position. Odd vanilla bug... 

        Bee Aggression:
            
            -   |
                Added two new tags to control whether the specifically tagged entity will get Wrath of the Hive automatically or not in 
                Bumblezone dimension. The calming tag will take presence over the angry tag. But both tags will override the default
                built-in behavior for that mob on if it automatically gets wrath or not in the dimension. Tags are:
                `the_bumblezone:bee_aggression_in_dimension/always_angry_at`
                `the_bumblezone:bee_aggression_in_dimension/forced_calm_at`

                Hanging Garden will now spawn some extra bug mobs from other mods! Such as butterflies, snails, fireflies, or other small cute bug.
                This controlled by a new entity tag called: `the_bumblezone:hanging_gardens_initial_spawn_entities`

        Block:
            
            -   |
                Fixed mobs pathfinding into lit Super Candles/Incense Candles and getting burned up.
                Now the wick cannot be pathfind through when lit.

            -   Fixed mobs unable to jump over Honey Crystal Block. Now they should pathfind around the block properly.

                Cleaned up how Enderpearl teleporting works when hitting Dreamland Biome's Bumble Beast or hits Productive Bees's Diamond Bee Nest Helmet.
                The following tags were added to handle the new way of doing compat and lets players add addition entities or items to hit to enter Bumblezone!

            -   |
                If entity hit is tagged `the_bumblezone:enderpearl_teleporting/target_entity_hit_anywhere`,
                will teleport thrower into Bumblezone.

                If entity hit is tagged `the_bumblezone:enderpearl_teleporting/target_entity_hit_high`,
                top half of hitbox must be hit to teleport thrower into Bumblezone.
                
            -   |
                If entity hit is tagged `the_bumblezone:enderpearl_teleporting/target_entity_hit_low`,
                bottom half of hitbox must be hit to teleport thrower into Bumblezone.

            -   |
                If entity hit is wearing armor tagged `the_bumblezone:enderpearl_teleporting/target_armor`, will teleport thrower into Bumblezone.
                (Helmet requires top 60% of hitbox. Chestplate require top 40%. Leggings require below 60%. Boots require below 40%)

            -   If entity hit is holding item tagged `the_bumblezone:enderpearl_teleporting/target_held_item`, will teleport thrower into Bumblezone.

            -   Fixed overlay issues with REI's tooltip while on Crystalline Flower's screen

            -   Ars Nouveau's Weald Walkers now spawn their respective sapling nearby when hit with Pollen Puff!

                Nerfed Crystalline Flower so that it requires 1453xp to reach max tier (About the same as player going from xp level 0 to 30)
                Previously, the flower required xp roughly about the same as a player going from 0 to 23 xp levels.
                Was complained about being too low for the ability to pick enchantments. Now it requires about double more xp.
                You can still increase or reduce this xp cost in the config file for Bumblezone.

        Items:
            
            -   Fixed Honey Compass tooltip not wrapping properly.

        Effects:

                They will play randomly in Bumblezone but they also have Music Disc forms obtainable from Wandering traders!
                The songs can be obtained from Bandcamp here from LudoCrypt:

            -   Connected Textures added for Porous Honeycomb Block and Empty Honeycomb Brood Block! Special thanks to EERussianguy!

            -   Added missing en_us translation for Crystalline Flower UI opening stat.

            -   Adjusted textures for Sugar Infused Stone and Sugar Infused Cobblestone a bit.

            -   Fixed Honeycomb Brood Block and Empty Honeycomb Brood Block facing the wrong way when in item form in inventory/creative menu.

            -   Honeycomb Brood Block now has many more animation variations so the block is not always in sync with other blocks of itself in the world.

            -   |
                Fixed Honeycomb Brood Block spawning an adult bee instead of a baby one when triggered to spawn a bee by Dispenser using 
                Glass Bottle, Honey Bottle, Sugar Water Bottle, or Honey Bucket on the stage 4 Honeycomb Brood Block.

            -   Fixed Honeycomb Brood Block not spawning bees properly outside Bumblezone and should more consistently spawn bees in Bumblezone when there's fewer mobs around.

            -   Carvable Wax block now has a facing property. Some patterns will face different directions based on how you place it!

            -   Glistering Honey Crystal now uses a facing property instead of axis property. Allows for more directions when placing for easier builds!

            -   Added sound for lighting Super/Incense Candles.

            -   Reduced duplicate entries in Bumblezone's Super Candle block and item tags.

            -   |
                Fixed Super Candles/Incense Candles not being waterlogged when placed in non-vanilla water tagged fluids. Fixed other watterlogging bug with them.
                Example, source Sugar Water was not waterlogging the Super Candles/Incense Candles when placed in it (Will be waterlogged with vanilla water when done so)

            -   Creative pick block (middle click) on Honey Crystal block now gives the proper Honey Crystal item instead of Honey Crystal Shards.

        Items:
            
            -   |
                Vanilla's Filled Maps now works in Bumblezone dimension properly!
                Many Bumblezone block's map colors were changed to look correct on maps.

            -   |
                Made an item form for all Carvable Wax blockstates to make building with it easier.
                Mining a Carvable Wax will drop the item form of its blockstate.

            -   Adjusted the stone textures of Bee Cannon and Crystal Cannon to match the texture change for Sugar Infused Stone/Sugar Infused Cobblestone.

            -   Adjusted the texture slightly for one variant of Stingless Bee Helmet and Bumble Bee Chestplate.

            -   Carpenter Bees boots now can mine through Carvable Wax block when crouched on top in center of block.

            -   Added tooltip descriptions to Honey Compass to make it more clear on how to use it.

            -   |
                Honey Compass now has a CustomName and CustomDescription nbt that takes a translation key to give it unique names or descriptions.
                Also now has a Locked nbt if you wish to spawn compasses that cannot be change to locate something else.
                These tags are used for the Honey Compass that locates a "mystery" structure.

            -   |
                Honey Compasses now only have the enchanted glint look if it is locating a Throne Pillar structure or is "locked" and cannot be made to locate anything else.
                Basically enchanted looking Honey Compass will not have the ability to right-click for saving Beehives/Bee Nests positions or locating Cell Maze.

            -   Bee Essence effect will now show message to player if lost on respawning if keepEssenceOfTheBeesOnRespawning config is set to false.

            -   Added command `\bumblezone is_bee_essenced` command to let any player check if they have Bee Essence still active. Does not need op status to use.

            -   Pollen Puff thrown at What Did You Vote For's Sniffer will spawn Moss Carpet nearby.

        Advancements:
            
            -   |
                Added `\bumblezone queen_desire_xxxxxxxx` commands. These commands let you see your progress towards many Queen Desire Advancements! 
                See the suggestion autocomplete for all options. Killed counter data requires an entity argument afterwards.

            -   Fixed Bee Bread and Royal Jelly Bottle being fed to bees not counting towards the Queen's Desire advancement about feeding bees.

            -   |
                Moved Essence of the Bee consuming advancement to be at the end of the Queen's Desire advancement tree.
                Resetting the Queen's Desire advancement line by Bee Queen when fully completed will not reset the
                Essence of the Bee consuming advancement to show you had previously beaten this advancement line before.

        Entities:
            
            -   Fixed right clicking Bee Queen with empty hand sometimes not resetting the Queen's Desire advancement line when all of those advancements are done.

        Enchantments:
            
            -   |
                Nerfed Neurotoxins enchantment so its missed counter does not increment if player hits entity while entity is already paralyzed.
                Helps prevent paralysis locking bosses.

            -   Made Neurotoxin require more bookshelves before showing up in Enchanting Table

            -   Made Potent Poison enchantment require 1 more bookshelf before showing up in Enchanting Table

        Teleportation:
            
            -   |
                Fixed display message for when teleporting to Bumblezone fails due to not having a certain required block below the hive.
                This is controlled by the_bumblezone:required_blocks_under_hive_to_teleport block tag which is empty by default to not need a required block for teleporting.

        Structures:
            
            -   |
                Added Hive Temple structure! A small Beeswax structure that has some persistent Honey Slimes and a small bit of loot.
                If you're lucky, you may find a Honey Compass in it that points to a Hanging Garden structure!

            -   Made Pollinated Streams structure now spawn above ground with pillar support! Looks cooler and much, much easier to find!

            -   Honey Cave Room structure is a bit more common now.

        Effects:
            
            -   Entities with Wrath of the Hive dying will remove the Wrath boosts from nearby bees that were targeting the Wrath afflicted mob.

        Mod Compatibility:
            
            -   Added config to allow turning off teleportation to Bumblezone if thrown Enderpearl hits top of the hitbox of a mob wearing Productive Bees's Bee Nest helmet.

            -   Quark's enchantment tooltip on enchanted books can now show Bumblezone's armor. (Especially helpful as boots can get mining enchantments)

            -   Enderpearls hitting top hitbox portion of Dreamland Biome's Bumble Beast will teleport players to Bumblezone dimension.

            -   Buzzer Bees's Bee Bottle now when right-clicked on Empty Honeycomb Brood Block will turn it into a regular Honeycomb Brood Block with a larva.

            -   Buzzier Bees's Crystallized Honey and Honeycomb Tiles blocks will spawn throughout Bumblezone.

        Mod Compatibility:
            
            -   Future-proofed Pollen Puff compat with Pokecube for when they change the registry name of some pokemon.

            -   Pollen Puff hitting Resourceful Bees's Crimson, Warped, Red, and Brown Bees will spawn those respective mushrooms nearby.

            -   Bee Queen will now trade for a ton more of Resourceful Bees's items!

            -   Added some methods in BumblezoneAPI class for other mods to have easier compat with Comb Cutter enchantment's beehive/bee nest drops.

            -   Enderpearls hitting top hitbox portion of players wearing Productive Bees's Bee Nest Helmets will teleport players to Bumblezone dimension.

        Dimension:

            -   |
                Added an internal Anti-Trypophobia resourcepack to this mod.
                You can enable it by going into the resourcepack screen and move the resourcepack to the top of the right side to activate it.
                Mostly just tries to make vanilla's Honeycomb Block and some of Bumblezone's hole-based blocks have lower contrast and look more flatter to help.
                This is not the desired look for Bumblezone but as a good last resort if you're feeling uncomfortable with the default textures.

                Some of these are specific to finding a certain structure or shouldn't be pickable at all. For balance or technical reasons.

            -   |
                Crystalline Flower now has crystallineFlowerExtraTierCost config added.
                This will increase the tier cost of all enchantments available by whatever value you add.
                Default is 0. Negative numbers will decrease the tier cost for enchantments.

            -   |
                Fixed Cell Maze not spawning. Sorry about that.

                Hanging Gardens will now spawn most flowers from the `minecraft:small_flowers` and `minecraft:tall_flowers` block tag including other mod's flowers.
                Use `the_bumblezone:blacklisted_hanging_garden_flowers` block tag to prevent certain small flower tagged blocks from spawning in Hanging Gardens.
                Use `the_bumblezone:allowed_hanging_garden_flowers` to add more flowers to spawn that are not in `minecraft:small_flowers` block tag.
                The tall flower versions of these tags are `the_bumblezone:blacklisted_hanging_garden_tall_flowers` and `the_bumblezone:allowed_hanging_garden_tall_flowers`

            -   Stopped Bumblezone's caves from eating away at part of Hanging Garden or Throne Pillar.

        Effects:
            
            -   Improved the effect icon textures for Beenergized, Hidden, Protection of the Hive, and Wrath of the Hive.

            -   |
                Wrath of the Hive's effect of growing nearby Brood blocks faster only applies if it is the player that has Wrath of the Hive.
                Wrath of the Hive level 1 is now throttled to only anger nearby bees every 20 ticks instead of every tick (spiders/bears/arthropods will have this level of wrath)
                Just a small change to squeeze out better performance on servers.

        Config:
            
            -   |
                Changed the default config value for keepBeeEssenceOnRespawning from false to true and renamed it to
                keepEssenceOfTheBeesOnRespawning so that everyone who had ran Bumblezone before now gets this true value.
                Less confusion this way.

            -   |
                Added defaultDimension config option for modpacks whose default dimension is not Overworld.
                Very very few people will ever need to touch this option. Let modpack makers be the ones to touch this only.

        Blocks:
            
            -   Fixed Comparator not correctly outputting power based on Crystalline Flower's height/tier.

        Items:

                Carpenter Bee Boots now only mines boot mineable blocks below you if you are more centered on the block.
                Crouching on block's edge won't mine the block anymore so you can crouch walk to not walk off edges or ledges.

        Mod Compatibility:

                Turning those off along with these two configs will disable flower's consuming entirely:

            -   |
                Added a third config called crystallineFlowerEnchantingPowerAllowedPerTier which sets the "enchanting power" of the flower per tier.
                Think of this like how Enchanting Tables only shows stronger or rarer enchantments when you have more bookshelves.
                Except here, the flower's tier times this config value is used as the threshold to know what enchantment and level to show.

                Right click it to open up a GUI where you can grow the plant by giving it you XP or stacks of items to consume. Grows up to 7 blocks (tiers) high.
                Put a book or enchanted book into the enchantment side and you can select what enchantment you want to add to it! This will cost some tiers to work.
                More and stronger enchantments are available the higher the block's tier! But you cannot add more enchantments to books that have 3 or more enchantments already.
                You can grow the block's tiers even outside the GUI by dropping items into the block or letting experience orbs touch the block!
                Some items grant more progress towards upgrading the tiers. And when using tiers to enchant, some Honey Crystal Shards will drop!
                You can blacklist items from consumption, blacklist what enchantments are available, or change what items can be enchanted by tags:

                that Incense Candles cannot be crafted with. The datapack would have the tag at this spot in order to work.
                `\data\the_bumblezone\tags\mob_effect\blacklisted_incense_candle_effects.json`

        Advancements:

                Added Glistering Honey Crystal block!
                A glowing light source of crystallized honey. Found only in Crystal Canyon biome in Bumblezone.
                Gives a high amount of Honey Crystal Shards when broken or can be smelted into a ton of Sticky Honey Residue.
                Great for decor or lighting! Also transform neighboring water source blocks into sugar water.
                If combined with an Awkward Potion in a Brewing Stand, it will create a Potion of Luck!
                The most common benefit of Luck status is it may improve the loot drops of certain datapack/modded loot tables.
            
            -   |
                Added Carvable Wax block!
                Right click with Shears or Swords to change the texture for it for decoration purposes!
                Can be crafted from 9 Beeswax. Or created from Smelting Beehive Beeswax.

            -   |
                Super Candles added! A massive decorative bulky candle that gives off a ton of light! Can be dyed various colors through crafting.
                Can be lit and waterlogged the same way as regular Minecraft Candles. Also can be lit by flaming projectile hits as well.
                When lit, any mob in the flame will be set on fire while taking low damage.
                Super Candles can be stacked and if Soul Sand/Soul Soil is placed under, it gets a soul flame that scares away Piglins!
                If a Comparator is facing the Super Candle Base, it gets a power of 5 when lit.
                If Comparator is facing the Super Candle Wick, it will get a power of 3 when it is a soul flame and 5 when it is a normal flame.
                Dispensers can light the Candle too.

            -   |
                Incense Candles added! A powerful magical candle that radiates its effects to nearby entities!
                On the surface, this candle has all the same behaviors as the regular Super Candles. Except these powerful Incense Candles
                can be imbued with different status effects to grant nearby entities based on what potions are used to craft the Incense Candle.
                When the Incense Candle's power runs out, the candle will become unlit.
                Relighting the candle will restart its status effects it gives.
                See what kind of Incense Candles you can make based on different potion combinations!

        Biomes:
            
            -   Added Crystal Canyon biome full of Carvable Wax and Glistering Honey Crystals!

        Items:
            
            -   Buffed Royal Jelly Bottle so it gives move saturation, nutrition, and speed when consumed. It now also gives Jump Boost and Slow Falling as well.

        Structures:
            
            -   Throne Pillar structure uses Glistering Honey Crystal instead of Jack o Lanterns now.

            -   Fixed Throne Pillar Honey Compass in Cell Maze structure not locating Throne Pillars.

        Entities:
            
            -   Bee Queen trade json files now will stack possible rewards properly if multiple files have the same want item.

        Dimensions:
            
            -   Fixed issue where ceiling of dimension could rarely generate to have holes to the outside of the dimension boundary.

        Config:
            
            -   |
                Added a new config to disable the thick fog in Bumblezone. Set to enable fog by default.

            -   |
                Added a new config to reduce the thickness of the fog in Bumblezone. Set to 4 by default to make fog 4 time less thick.

                Ported to 1.19.2. Music Disc constructors changed a bit in 1.19.1 which requires me to release this fix.
                Requires Forge v43.0.8 or newer to fix a DFU dimension bug.

        Language:

            -   Fixed Bee Queen healing superfast and thus, unkillable.

            -   Added more alternative Bee skins added by Shy!

        Teleportation:
            
            -   Fixed issue where mobs that spawned in Bumblezone originally would teleport to incorrect coordinates when exiting Bumblezone.

            -   |
                Added a new config option called forceBumblezoneOriginMobToOverworldCenter which is set to true by default now.
                If set to true, mobs that spawned in Bumblezone originally will teleport to 0,0 world center of Overworld always at top of terrain.
                Hopefully this is more intuitive and prevent lost Bee Queens when pushing them out of Bumblezone.

        Language:

                Added checks to shield against missing capabilities on serverPlayers that Forge was supposed to keep alive but for some
                unknown reason, just lets the caps get nuked which kills my mod. Now null cap crashes should be gone for good.
                I wrapped all my caps grabs with checks to make sure the cap exists as my nuclear option for Forge's instability with caps.
                Yes this is a ~~gamer~~ modder rant.

                Redid the `bz_pollen_puff_entity_flowers` json folder so now the entries can take a weighted list of plants to pick from
                and can match the entity's nbt. This means now that Brown Mooshrooms will spawn Brown Mushrooms instead of Red Mushrooms!
                Hitting Earth Mobs Mod's muddy pigs with Pollen Puff will now spawn a random tulip nearby!

            -   |
                Pollen Puff's `bz_pollen_puff_entity_flowers` json entries can now take air block entries safely.
                Air entries can be used to make spawning plants more rare when the mob is hit by Pollen Puff.
                Many mossy mobs from other mods now have their rates of spawning Moss Carpet or Azalea now lowered as a result to balance.

        Mod Compatibility:
            
            -   Friends and Foe's Mauler will now sometimes spawn Moss Carpet when hit with Pollen Puff.

                Fixed crash when Alex's Mob's bear tries to break and eat a beehive.
                They passed null into beehivetileentity.emptyAllLivingFromHive which crashed my code.
                I added a null check to my code to fix this.

                Teleporting to and from Bumblezone is now mostly async to reduce server lag/deadlock.
                This is new and a bit of an experiment so please report any issues that arises from teleporting to and from Bumblezone.

            -   Reduced the jittering screen a bit when exiting Bumblezone by going below Y = 0.

            -   Fixed teleporting in/out of Bumblezone message not showing up while teleporting instead of afterwards.

        Structures:
            
            -   |
                Cell maze now has a slightly higher chance of having a Throne Pillar locating Honey Compass in the Honey Cocoon blocks.
                The special compass will also have a higher chance of showing up if you have luck status effect/attribute.

        Language:

                Fixed entities spawning below y = 0 in Bumblezone somehow which was causing the teleportation code to trigger which then
                would force the Overworld to generate its chunk which then lags the game. With this fix in place, Bumblezone worldgen is
                literally as fast as I can possibly make it. There's no further improvement I can do as it is blazingly fast now.

            -   Made special bee spawning mechanics in Bumblezone ignore Fake players for performance.

        Structures:
            
            -   Optimized Bumblezone structure layout creation much faster than what vanilla allows.

                Fixed Honey Cocoon loading loot tables by itself randomly.
                This should prevent some lag when they first load in from worldgen.

            -   |
                Honey Compass now locates structures in an async way so server should not lag when using a Honey Compass to find Cell Maze/Throne Pillar structures.

                Drinking this item will restore high amount of Hunger, Speed Boost, and Beenergized level 2!
                It will also remove Poison, Weakness, and Slowness status effects when drank as well.
                You can trade this item back to the Bee Queen for a chance at some valuable rewards!
                Can be fed to bees to give extremely high and long lived Beenergized effect (and also grants very high friendship points with Beehemoths).

                Pollen Puff can be thrown at Mooshrooms to spawn Red Mushrooms nearby!
                Other mobs can be made to spawn flowers as well by adding new files to bz_pollen_puff_entity_flowers by datapack.
